 Ruby comes pre-installed on Mac, however, if the version is older than 2.1 you'll need to install the latest version.

 To check your installed versions, open your terminal and type:
 {% highlight ruby %}
 'ruby -v' #=> To check your ruby version
 'gem -v' #=> To check your gem version
 'jekyll -v' #=> To check your Jekyll version
#=> These commands work on both Mac and Windows, so go ahead and try them out.
 {% endhighlight %}
