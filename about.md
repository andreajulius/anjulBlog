We are two Master students studying Digital Humanities at the University of Mainz in Germany. We were given the topic “Jekyll” to learn within a week and present it to our classmates! Boy, what a challenge! Well, this website was created in lieu of presentation slides. ;)

We hope we’ve done the topic a little bit of justice (hey, you’re on our website!). For any comments - good or bad - please contact us on the deets below.

Otherwise have fun reading and hopefully learning some Jekyll too!

P.S: We will try to keep this site updated with many more posts, so we hope to see you guys here soon.
